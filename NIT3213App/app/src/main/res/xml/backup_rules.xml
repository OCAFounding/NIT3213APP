    backup_rules.xml - Backup Rules for NIT3213App
    
    This file defines what data should be included in automatic backups.
    Android automatically backs up app data to Google Drive when:
    - User has backup enabled in device settings
    - App is installed on a new device
    - User restores from backup
    
    IMPORTANT: This file is only used on devices with API 31+ (Android 12+)
    For older devices, backup behavior is controlled by android:allowBackup in AndroidManifest.xml

        BACKUP RULES CONFIGURATION

        - SharedPreferences
        - Internal storage files
        - Database files
        - Cache files (excluded by default)
        
        You can customize what gets backed up using include/exclude rules:
