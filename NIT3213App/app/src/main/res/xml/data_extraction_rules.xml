    data_extraction_rules.xml - Data Extraction Rules for NIT3213App
    
    This file defines rules for data extraction during device-to-device transfers
    and cloud backups. It's part of Android 12+ (API 31+) backup and restore system.
    
    This file works alongside backup_rules.xml to provide fine-grained control
    over what data gets transferred when users:
    - Set up a new device
    - Transfer data between devices
    - Restore from cloud backup

        Controls what data is included in cloud backups (Google Drive)

            CLOUD BACKUP CONFIGURATION
            Currently using default behavior (most data backed up)
            
            You can customize cloud backup behavior by uncommenting and modifying:

        <!--
            EXAMPLE CLOUD BACKUP RULES:
            
            <!-- Include all SharedPreferences in cloud backup -->
            <!-- <include domain="sharedpref" path="."/> -->
            
            <!-- Exclude sensitive data from cloud backup -->
            <!-- <exclude domain="sharedpref" path="user_credentials.xml"/> -->
            
            <!-- Include user data database -->
            <!-- <include domain="database" path="user_data.db"/> -->
            
            <!-- Exclude cache files from cloud backup -->
            <!-- <exclude domain="file" path="cache/"/> -->

        DEVICE TRANSFER RULES
        Controls what data is included when transferring to a new device
        (Currently commented out - using default behavior)

        <!--
            DEVICE TRANSFER CONFIGURATION
            Device transfer rules can be different from cloud backup rules
            For example, you might want to transfer more data locally than to cloud
            
            EXAMPLE DEVICE TRANSFER RULES:
            
            <!-- Include all user data for device transfer -->
            <!-- <include domain="sharedpref" path="."/> -->
            <!-- <include domain="database" path="."/> -->
            
            <!-- Exclude temporary files from device transfer -->
            <!-- <exclude domain="file" path="temp/"/> -->
        -->
    </device-transfer>
    -->
    
    <!--
